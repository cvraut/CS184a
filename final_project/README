This directory contains the final project for this course.


We were to find a PCA study then use their datasets to recreate the study.


I chose the study found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447764/ 

About genetic variation between tomatoes and the results of a PCA on the SNP's.


All my python code is in the jupyter notebook (*imp. it is a python 2 notebook)

The notebook and the html version of the notebook are too large for github to render, so you would need to download either of them to view in detail what I did & how I did it.

If you don't want to download anything, I have included a 2 page writeup highlighting the important parts of the study and the assignment.
