This homework assignment asks us to analyze a fastq file, calculating the accuracy of each nucleotide that was sequenced & practicing to use python to plot them.

To use the python script:
 - I wrote it to work in python?
 - run & the 1st plot produced should be a histogram of the max's and min's
   - I thought it was pretty interesting that the maximum accuracy for a single nucleotide in every sequence was identical 
   - On the other hand the minimum ended up clustering into 2 distinct groups
 - Closing the 1st plot by clicking on the x in teh upper right leads to the 2nd plot which is an interactive scatterplot of the mean vs median accuracies with a y=x line added to see which sequences strayed away from symmetric distributions of probabilities.
 - Clicking any of the points causes a violinplot of the accuracies of the nucleotides in that sequence to be produced.
