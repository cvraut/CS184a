A written abstract for why I want to sequence an ant.

TLDR: 
I have been at war with this specific species of ant for over 15 months.
They have taken the comfort of my home, my sanity, my food, and my generous applications of pesticide.
I hope to learn more about them through their genetic code to finally eradicate them.


Also I have identified a nice genome PCA paper to use for my final project:
