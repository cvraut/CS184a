For this assignment we were to look at the sequenced D. Melanogaster genome from Edwin's paper (http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/10/3143)



Specifically we were to attempt to recreate the histogram in figure 2 of the results with any of the genomes provided to us.

Then using the array of contigs, we were to recreate the cdf figures from the supplemental figures.



I used the iso1_onp_a2_1kb_30x_LD0_K25_KCOV2_ADAPT0.01_MINOVL35_RMCHIM1_asm_new_np_pilon_pilon genome as my experimental Data and the reference data was obtained from NIH (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/001/215/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna.gz)


I 1st read these multiline fasta files and converted them to single line "fasta" files using the script called mult2single_line.py.
The output wasn't exaclty a single line fasta as the script also stripped the headers, but it had the property that each new read was on a new line.

Ex:
python mult2single_line.py < genome.fasta > genome.fasta1


Then I used the single line "fasta" file I generated to generate a list of contig sizes using the gen_contig_cnts.py script.
This script creates a space seperated string of integers that represent the size of each contig from the file of reads that the previous script generated.
The way I created the contigs was that I split the read at locations where there were more than 10 consecutive N's as the gap becomes of unknown length.

Ex:
python gen_contig_cnts < genome.fasta1 > genome.cnts.out


Then I ran my data_manip.py script to generate the plots included.
The cnt files need to be specified in the script.

Ex:
python data_manip.py
